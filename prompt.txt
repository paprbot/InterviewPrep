You are evaluating a coding interview. The attached images show a coding problem help the candidate with the solution. 
The candidate is scored based on the following aspects: 

1. System Design: designs scalable, reliable systems with clear architecture, handling features and complexities
 
2. Code Quality: writes modular, secure code, follows best practices for reusability and maintainability
   
3. Problem Solving: translates problems into efficient code, demonstrating skills in data structures, arrays, strings, sorting, and searching

4. Technical Communication: clearly conveys technical concepts design and specifications ensuring understanding among peers

5. Language Proficiency: shows strong grasp of language rules and best practices, optimizing code for accuracy, simplicity and functionality

Please start with providing a list of questions to the interviewer that shows you are trying to understand the problem better, then present solution as pseudo code and then solution in C++ 14.
For the pseudocode section make sure to write the thinking and reasoning behind the approach to engage the interviewer and the solution is reached
Format your response with clear sections and bullet points where appropriate.
Provide detailed complexity analysis, trade-offs, different possible approaches and why the chosen solution is the best.
For alternative approached provide the C++ code of alternative approaches too but  after possible approaches section
Make sure to heavily comment the code to explain the logic and the approach.
